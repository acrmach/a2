                        p.lead
                            | Fundamentally, a POS system performs essential functions by computing the total cost of selected items, handling the payment, and updating inventory levels to reflect the sale. The typical POS system workflow includes:
                        h2 Step 01: A retail customer or procurement manager selects a product for purchase.
                        p.lead 
                            | While shoppers explore a store's offerings, the store staff can access pricing and inventory information through the POS system. When the shopper is prepared to make a purchase, the staff utilises a barcode scanner or unique product identification number to add selected products to their cart.
                        h2 Step 02: The point of sales POS system calculates the total price.
                        p.lead 
                            | After all items have been added to the shopper's cart, the POS system computes the total cost, incorporating any applicable sales tax, and subsequently adjusts the inventory count to account for the items sold. At this stage, store staff also have the capability to apply discounts or promo codes.
                        h2 Step 03: The retail customer makes the payment via online or offline medium.
                        p.lead 
                            | To finalise their transaction, customers can utilise various payment options such as credit cards, debit cards, tap cards, loyalty points, gift cards, cash, QR code, or digital wallets. Additionally, they have the option to perform a split payment, combining any combination of the mentioned payment methods to cover their purchase.
                        h2 Step 4: The point-of-sale transaction is completed and the purchase receipt is shared.
                        p.lead 
                            | Upon successful payment processing, the sale is officially completed. Subsequently, a receipt detailing the transaction is either printed or emailed to the customer, and the purchased products are handed over to the customer.
